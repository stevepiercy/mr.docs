Update
======

Update the image
----------------

The only thing what you have to do is a new pull of the image:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker pull quay.io/tiramisu/mr.docs

Update to 2.0
--------------

With the release of mr.docs version 2.0 we renamed the function file form *.dockerfunc* to *.mrdocsfunc*.

We also did some slight modifications to it, the easiest way for updating from version 1.0 to 2.0 is to remove *.dockerfunc* and :doc:`download .mrdocsfunc <setup>`.

All about updating of the container, and all about updating with version updates like new functions and so on
