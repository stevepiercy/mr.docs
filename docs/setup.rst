Setup
=====

To make it easy we use some functions to talk with our container

.. gist:: https://gist.github.com/svx/45d6a801c3bd21630356

Download it and save it as for example as dockerfunc

.. code-block:: bash

    $ wget https://gist.github.com/svx/45d6a801c3bd21630356 -O ~/.dockerfunc

.. example-code::
    .. code-block:: Debian

        sudo apt install htop

    .. code-block:: Fedora

        sudo dnf install htop
